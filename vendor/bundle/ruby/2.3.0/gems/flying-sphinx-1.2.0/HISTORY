1.1.0 - 15th March 2014

0.8.5 - 10th December 2012
* Daemon actions (start/stop) are now asynchronous.
* More forgiving when environment variables aren't around. Particularly helpful for Padrino and Sinatra.

* Log SSH exceptions during indexing (when we're being verbose).
* This history file now exists (pre-populated).
* An actual README, courtesy of some prodding by Mislav.
* Added support for wordforms (automatically sent through to the server).
* Don't presume that ENV['DATABASE_URL'] exists - it won't in non-Heroku environments.

0.5.1 - 23rd June 2011
* Adding rake as a development dependency, just for Travis CI.
* Have a default database port - Cedar stack doesn't set it by default.
* Allow for newer net-ssh gem versions (including 2.1).

* Set the Thinking Sphinx database adapter when loaded, instead of requiring the Rails dispatcher to setup.

0.4.1 - 24th January 2011
* Comparing against response bodies for consistency (and avoiding HTTParty magic).

0.4.0 - 18th January 2011
* Using HTTPS for API calls.
* Using Flying Sphinx server's account identifier instead of the heroku id from the environment (the latter being unreliable and not part of any official Heroku add-on documentation).
